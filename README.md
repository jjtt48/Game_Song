## Project Description:
This project consists of composing a battle theme for **Final Fantasy I** using OpenMusic (OM). The composition was created following the limitations and requirements provided, including generating music programmatically within OM, without using pre-stored audio files. We chose a piano as the only instrument for the theme, and the composition is designed to align with the classic battle themes of Final Fantasy I.

## How It Was Done:
1. **Choice of Instrument**: We decided to use only a piano to maintain the simplicity and focus on melodic structure, as Final Fantasy I features minimalistic yet powerful music, often emphasizing melody.
   
2. **Algorithmic Composition**: Using OpenMusic, we created an algorithm to generate the notes of the composition. The algorithm includes elements like random number generation and loops to ensure variation in the melody while keeping the piece cohesive and fitting for a battle scenario.

3. **Program Structure**: 
   - We used conditionals, loops, and data structures provided by OM to control the flow of the composition and to introduce dynamic changes throughout the piece.
   - The piece lasts 2 minutes, with at least 1 minute of non-repetitive music, as required by the project guidelines.



## Why It Was Done This Way:
We chose a minimalistic approach with a single piano instrument to mirror the simplicity and clarity of early **Final Fantasy** music, while still ensuring that the battle theme remains engaging and effective for a video game setting. The decision to use algorithmic composition methods like random generation was to introduce variability while maintaining coherence. This aligns with the dynamic nature of battles, where repetition can be tiresome, and unpredictability adds excitement.
